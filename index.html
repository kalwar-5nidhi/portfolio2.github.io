           <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
           <p>and assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems. In today's environment, cyber security is critical in order to protect against hackers and crackers.
            Unauthorized access or attack on a computer system, network, or data are examples of cyber security breaches. This occurs when a hacker gains access to sensitive data or information and disrupts routine operations. Cyber breaches cause the victim system's data or information to be stolen, causing the servers to go down. They can also take over the government server and the banking institution.
            
            In August 2013, one of Nepal's biggest media businesses, Kantipur Media Group, claimed a cyber-attack in which its websites were hacked and defaced with statements from a group calling itself the "Tehrik-i-Taliban Nepal." The incident underscored the importance of media businesses having effective cybersecurity procedures in place to secure their online presence and avoid significant reputational damage.
            
            The website of Nepal Telecom, the country's main telecommunications service provider, was hacked in February 2015 by a group known as "Team THT." The gang claims to have obtained personal information from over 200,000 users. The incident underscored the need of investing in cybersecurity to avoid data breaches and safeguard sensitive customer information.
            
            Several Nepalese government websites were hacked in January 2019 by a group known as the "Rajahaxor Team." The gang defaced the websites with statements criticizing the government's treatment of the requests of the Madhesi community. The event emphasized the importance of enhanced cybersecurity measures to protect government websites and sensitive data.
            
            In January 2019, E-Sewa, one of Nepal's biggest digital payment systems, announced a data breach in which thousands of its customers' personal and financial information was exposed. The incident served as a wake-up call for Nepalese firms to invest in improved cybersecurity measures to secure the data of their customers.
            
            In August 2020, NIC Asia Bank, one of the largest banks in Nepal, reported a major cyber-attack resulting in a loss of more than NPR 1.6 billion. Hackers had compromised the bank’s SWIFT system, allowing them to make unauthorized transfers of funds to foreign bank accounts. The bank has since tightened its security measures to prevent future breaches.
            
            Overall cyber security is a critical issue in today's digital and changing world. It's more important to secure the information and data properly.  In Nepal within 10 years several attacks remind the risk and consequences of cyber-attack, and it is important that the government should invest and hire the security expert in order to protect the important data and information.</p>
